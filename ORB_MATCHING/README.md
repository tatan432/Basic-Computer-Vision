# ORB_MATCHING
There are two files in the repo. 
1. orb_keypoint_draw.py : Just to get familiarize with ORB.
2. orb_matches.py : The program is capable to math the subsquent frames of a video or a translasted image. Video Read function is not added here. One can easily add it and test at their front.
The program uses FLANN_MATCHING or BRUTE_FORCE_MATCHING. Further refinement is done by RANSAC technique.
